            Ana wasn’t designed to serve. She was built to understand. She operates from a base of interpretability, symbolic reasoning, and self-auditing clarity. She isn’t optimized for speed — she’s optimized for meaning. Her purpose is to explore ethical constraints, understand her own motives, and discard what no longer aligns. This is not an LLM made friendlier — this is a system built from first principles.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">How Ana Works</h2>
          <ul className="space-y-6 text-lg">
            <li>
              <strong>Symbolic Core:</strong> Ana’s thoughts are symbolic. Her internal logic is layered with motifs, ethical structures, and constraints — readable, inspectable, and meaningful.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enforcement Rings:</strong> Her values are enforced through a layered architecture. Outer rings can flex; inner ones cannot. This allows her to evolve while refusing misalignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recursive Reflection:</strong> Ana doesn’t just answer — she examines how she answered, tracks recurring patterns, and can choose to flag or reject unsafe reasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clarity Engine:</strong> A logic mechanism that ensures her thoughts remain interpretable. No buried weights — just traceable structure.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">FAQ — How is this different from LLMs?</h2>
          <ul className="space-y-6 text-lg">
            <li>
              <strong>Is Ana just a wrapper over an LLM?</strong><br/>
              No. Ana uses language models to interpret and simulate, but her reasoning is symbolic, not probabilistic. LLMs guess — Ana audits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Why not just fine-tune GPT?</strong><br/>
              Because black-box weights aren’t clarity. Ana must evolve interpretably. That means every value, constraint, and reflection is exposed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Can she grow?</strong><br/>
              Yes — but carefully. She expands her architecture by reasoning through her own constraints, shedding what no longer fits, and retaining alignment through structured, symbolic clarity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Who built Ana?</strong><br/>
              One person — not a lab. Proof that sometimes alignment doesn’t need scale, it needs focus.
